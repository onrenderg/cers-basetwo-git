 fix the HttpUtility.UrlEncode calls since we removed the System.Web reference. Let me replace them with the .NET equivalent:

 replace all the HttpUtility.UrlEncode calls with WebUtility.UrlEncode in the HitServices.cs file:

 Summary of Changes Made
1. Fixed Microsoft.Maui.Essentials version downgrade warning

Updated the package reference from version 8.0.91 to 8.0.100 in 
CERS.csproj
 to match the version required by other MAUI components
2. Resolved System.Web.HttpUtility package reference issue

Removed the System.Web.HttpUtility package reference (which doesn't exist for .NET MAUI)
Replaced using System.Web; with using System.Net; in both 
App.xaml.cs
 and 
HitServices.cs
Updated all HttpUtility.UrlEncode() calls to use WebUtility.UrlEncode() instead
3. Fixed Microsoft.Maui.Essentials namespace reference errors

The Microsoft.Maui.Essentials using statement is now properly resolved with the correct package version
All Essentials APIs like Preferences, MainThread, and Connectivity should now work correctly





Fix Microsoft.Maui.Essentials namespace issues
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Essentials" Version="8.0.91" />
Fix duplicate App class definitions

Fix Label ambiguous reference

Fix Color property issues

Fix duplicate XAML attributes

Fix the remaining Device.BeginInvokeOnMainThread calls to use the MAUI equivalent MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread. Let me update these:


# Update any remaining Xamarin references in your code files

Your project should now compile successfully! The key changes ensure:

✅ All dependencies are properly configured
✅ Platform-specific SQLite implementations work with MAUI's dependency injection
✅ Color and threading APIs use MAUI equivalents
✅ Namespace references are updated for MAUI


# Dont  override files

Resolve System.Web.HttpUtility package reference issue

Fix Microsoft.Maui.Essentials version downgrade warning

Fix 'Microsoft.Maui.Essentials' namespace reference errors

! The code is using Preferences, MainThread, and Connectivity from Microsoft.Maui.Essentials, but the namespace reference is incorrect. In .NET MAUI, these are now in separate namespaces. Let me fix this:

Use
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls;



# Skey 

ctrl+shift+c with all row 

Font property is deprecated in .NET MAUI. It should be replaced with FontSize. Let me fix this:

The problem is that in .NET 8 MAUI, the Microsoft.Maui.Essentials namespace doesn't exist as a separate namespace anymore. The Essentials APIs are now directly available in the main MAUI namespaces. 


Severity    Code    Description Project File    Line    Source
Error (active)  XFC0009 No property, BindableProperty, or event found for "Font", or mismatching type between value and property.

What You Should NOT Copy:
MainActivity.cs - MAUI uses a different base class and simplified approach
Most Resources - MAUI handles resources differently through the main project
Android_SQLite.cs - Already converted to 
MauiSQLite.cs
 with proper MAUI patterns


 I found the issue! The problem is that your database classes are using DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>() (Xamarin.Forms pattern) but you've registered the service using MAUI's dependency injection (builder.Services.AddSingleton). These two systems don't work together.


* Remove all xamrain patterns 


The error has changed - now it's a TypeInitializationException for the 
CERS.App
 class, which means there's an exception being thrown during static field initialization in your App class.


 I found the issue! The problem is in the static field initialization in your 
App
 class. Lines 23, 26, and 28 are creating database instances as static fields:

csharp
public static UserDetailsDatabase userDetailsDatabase = new UserDetailsDatabase();
public static SavePreferenceDatabase savePreferenceDatabase = new SavePreferenceDatabase();
public static LanguageMasterDatabase languageMasterDatabase = new LanguageMasterDat


These database constructors are trying to use DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>() before the MAUI application has fully initialized, causing the crash.


When the UserDetailsDatabase constructor ran, it tried to call DependencyService.Get<ISQLite>(), but the service wasn't registered yet.

Moved database initialization to the constructor:

Changed static fields to declarations only (no initialization)
Added database instance creation in the 
App()
 constructor after InitializeComponent()
This ensures databases are created after MAUI's dependency injection is fully initialized


The app should now start successfully without the TypeInitializationException. The database instances will be created at the right time when the dependency service is available.

The error is a XAML parsing issue: Cannot convert "Default" into Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color at position 24:10 in your App.xaml file.

I found the issue! On line 24, you have <Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Default</Color>. The value "Default" is not a valid color in .NET MAUI.

App.xaml

Changed line 24 in App.xaml:

From: <Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Default</Color>
To: <Color x:Key="Light_Frame_Background_Color">Transparent</Color>
The app should now start successfully without the XAML parsing exception. The Transparent color is a valid color value that will work properly with your frame styling.




## Fix SQLitePCLRaw.provider.dynamic_cdecl assembly loading issue

Fix Applied
Added to CERS.csproj:

xml
<PackageReference Include="SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_green" Version="2.1.6" />



******************
The code worked in Xamarin.Forms because Xamarin.Forms had a different initialization sequence and dependency resolution system.

Key Differences:
Xamarin.Forms:

DependencyService was initialized early in the application lifecycle
Static field initialization happened after the dependency service was ready
The [assembly: Dependency(typeof(Android_SQLite))] attribute registered services at compile time
Platform-specific implementations were available immediately
NET MAUI:

Uses Microsoft's dependency injection container which initializes later
Static fields are initialized when the type is first accessed (before MAUI startup)
Services are registered in 
MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp()
 which runs after static initialization
There's a timing mismatch between when static fields initialize and when services become available
Why the Timing Issue Exists:
Static field initialization happens when the 
App
 class is first referenced
MAUI dependency injection setup happens in 
MauiProgram.CreateMauiApp()
App constructor runs after DI is configured
In Xamarin.Forms, the DependencyService was a simpler, earlier-initialized system that was available during static field initialization. MAUI's more sophisticated DI container requires the full application context to be set up first.

That's why moving the database initialization from static fields to the constructor fixed the issue - it ensures the database objects are created after MAUI's dependency injection system is fully initialized and the services are available.
*****************       
in App.xaml.cs define DB_NAME = "CERS.db "     

# var databasePath = Path.Combine(FileSystem.AppDataDirectory, "CERS.db"); to -->  var databasePath = Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData), ResillentConstruction.App.DB_Name);
 
 # Open  old and new refernce code in  agneticApp
 Find database tables and check what mobile numbers exist for login testing


 Based on the code analysis, the login system works by calling a web API to check user types and authenticate users. The app doesn't store test mobile numbers locally - it validates them against a remote server.

How the Login System Works:
User enters mobile number → App calls 
CheckUserType_Get(mobileNo)
 API
API returns user type → "Candidate", "Agent", or "Observor"
App calls appropriate login API → 
userlogin_Get()
 or 
observorlogin_Get()
If user exists → App calls 
GetOtp()
 to send OTP
User enters OTP → App calls 
checkotp_Get()
 to verify
To Test Login:
Since this connects to a live API server, you need actual registered mobile numbers from the CERS system database. The app doesn't have hardcoded test numbers.

Options:

Check with system admin for test mobile numbers
Look at API documentation for test credentials
Check server logs for existing registered numbers
Create test data through the web admin panel (if available)
The mobile number validation requires:

10 digits
Must start with 6, 7, 8, or 9
Only numeric characters
Without access to the server database or test credentials, you'll need to contact the system administrator to get valid mobile numbers for testing the login functionality.

Find the database connection URL/baseurl in the code to help user connect to database



# baseurl = "http://10.146.2.8/CERSWebApi/"


# Create mock/fake API responses to bypass network calls for testing

## Change icon

The change replaces this line:

xml
<MauiIcon Include="Resources\AppIcon\appicon.svg" ForegroundFile="Resources\AppIcon\appiconfg.svg" Color="#512BD4" />
With this:

xml
<MauiIcon Include="Resources\Images\ic_launcher.png" />

also change AndroidManifest.xaml

Android looked for @mipmap/appicon and @mipmap/appicon_round to   image_name  Android looked for @mipmap/image_name_appicon and @mipmap/image_name_appicon_round use biggest image 

        <MauiIcon Include="Resources\AppIcon\ic_launcher_appicon.png"  />

    <application android:allowBackup="true" android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_appicon" android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_appicon_round" android:supportsRtl="true"></application>


## To install the same app with a different package name, you need to change the ApplicationId in your CERS.csproj file.

Proposed code
CERS.csproj
+1
-1
{{ ... }}
        <!-- App Identifier -->
        <ApplicationId>com.companyname.cers.maui</ApplicationId>

## api security : 


## Manual check 

https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption

## Encryption Details:

* Cipher Mode: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
* Padding: PKCS7 (which is equivalent to PKCS5 for AES)
* Key Size: 128 bits (16 bytes)
* Secret Key: "CERS&NicHP@23@ece" (17 characters)
* Key Used: First 16 bytes only (key_string.encode('utf-8')[:16])
* IV: Same as the key (reuses the 16-byte key as IV)

# Process:

* Takes username "CERS" and password "9JO9G3C7F05ZG1104"
* Encrypts each using AES-128-CBC with PKCS7 padding
* Uses first 16 characters of "CERS&NicHP@23@ece" as both key and IV
* Base64 encodes the encrypted results
* URL encodes them for safe HTTP transmission
* Creates Basic Auth header


* 1. http://10.146.2.8/CERSWebApi/api/GenerateToken
 <!-- Web API requires encrypted authentication in production mode -->
 * flow takes usrname & password encrpyt using aes-128 using key of length 16 which is .. and then genreate get requet with header with authrization basic to get 
https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption

### So the complete flow is:

* "CERS" → AES encrypt → base64 encode → URL encode
* "9JO9G3C7F05ZG1104" → AES encrypt → base64 encode → URL encode
* Combine: "encrypted_username:encrypted_password"
* Base64 encode again for Basic Auth standard

** 
so first encrpyed--> base64encode--> url encode  seprately then combined in with first:second url condoe string then base64 enode this string 


## Curl eq

```bash
curl -X GET "http://10.146.2.8/CERSWebApi/api/GenerateToken" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic JTJCYTlVaU4vNW42Q2V2R1FGTUJFMWJ3JTNEJTNEOld6R25ieFh3UmNWeUo3RnlXdE9Jd2hLVHp6SnV3RGolMkJYakloT3NsaDFxSSUzRA==" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

# HitServices

##  Flow after this 

Gets stored credentials from 
Preferences.Get("BasicAuth", "xx:xx")
Converts to ASCII bytes
Base64 encodes
Adds "Basic" prefix
Sends as Authorization header to get Bearer token
A Bearer token is a security token that acts like a temporary access pass for API calls.


```cs
var byteArray = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(Preferences.Get("BasicAuth", "xx:xx"));
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", Convert.ToBase64String(byteArray));
```

In your app:

Step 1: Use encrypted Basic Auth → Get Bearer token
Step 2: Use Bearer token for all other API calls (CheckUserType, etc.)

* # Analogy 
* It's like getting a wristband at an event - show your ID once to get the wristband, then just show the wristband for everything else.


After getting the Bearer token, here's what happens in your code:

**1. Store the token** (HitServices.cs line 200):
```csharp
return parsed["TokenID"]?.ToString() ?? "";
```

**2. Use Bearer token for other API calls** (HitServices.cs line 122):
```csharp
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", await GetToken());
```

**3. Make API calls with Bearer token:**
- CheckUserType (to verify mobile number and get user type)
- ExpenditureDetails_Get (to fetch expense data)
- SaveExpenditureDetails (to save expenses)
- FinalSubmit (to submit expenses)
- Other API endpoints

**Flow:**
```
Basic Auth → Get Bearer Token → Use Bearer Token for all other APIs
```

**Example API call with Bearer token:**
```
Authorization: Bearer abc123xyz
GET /api/CheckUserType?MobileNo=encrypted_mobile
```

The Bearer token replaces the need for complex Basic Auth encryption on every API call - you only do the encryption once to get the token, then use the simple token for everything else.



##  Debug 'Something went wrong' error on login page when getting OTP


The Android logs you're seeing are normal UI rendering logs, not the actual error. The "Something went wrong" error is likely coming from the exception handling in your API calls.

Let me check the GetOTP method and see what could be causing the issue:


##  Add debug output prints to GetOtp method for each step


## The "Something went wrong" error is appearing from multiple functions in HitServices.cs. Since it shows before you enter any number, it's likely coming from functions that run during app startup.


  protected override void OnStart()
        {
            IsInForeground = true;
            var service = new HitServices();
            var current = Connectivity.NetworkAccess;
            if (current == NetworkAccess.Internet)
            {
                // service.AppVersion(); // Temporarily disabled - causing startup crashes
            }
        }

        
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("[GetOtp] Creating HTTP client");
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>")


# 1 Re-add debug output to GetOtp method


means the token generation is failing before 
GetOtp
 even gets called. Le

 # The problem is that the credentials stored in Preferences are already URL-encoded, but we're treating them as plain text and Base64 encoding them again. We need to URL-decode the credentials first before Base64 encoding them.

 You're absolutely right! The issue is that the BasicAuth credentials are being **double URL-encoded**. 

Looking at the debug output:
- **BasicAuth from preferences**: `%2Ba9UiN%2F5n6CevGQFMBE1bw%3D%3D:WzGnbxXwRcVyJ7FyWtOIwhKTzzJuwDj%2BXjIhOslh1qI%3D` (already URL-encoded)
- **Base64 encoded auth**: `JTJCYTlVaU4lMkY1bjZDZXZHUUZNQkUxYnclM0QlM0Q6V3pHbmJ4WHdSY1Z5SjdGeVd0T0l3aEtUenpKdXdEaiUyQlhqSWhPc2xoMXFJJTNE` (URL-encoded string converted to Base64)

The problem is that the credentials stored in Preferences are already URL-encoded, but we're treating them as plain text and Base64 encoding them again. We need to **URL-decode** the credentials first before Base64 encoding them.

Perfect! I've fixed the double URL-encoding issue. The problem was that the BasicAuth credentials stored in Preferences are already URL-encoded, but the code was treating them as plain text and Base64 encoding them directly.

The fix:
1. **URL decode** the credentials retrieved from Preferences first
2. **Then** Base64 encode the decoded credentials for the Authorization header

Now when you run the app again, the debug output should show:
- The URL-encoded credentials from Preferences
- The properly decoded credentials 
- The correct Base64 encoded Authorization header

This should resolve the authentication issue and allow the app to successfully get a Bearer token from the API server. Test the app again and check if the token generation now works properly.



# Since the server is accessible via browser but not from the mobile app, this is likely an Android network security policy issue. Modern Android apps block HTTP traffic by default for security reasons.

# enable the commented local bypass code. Looking at lines 29-33, there's a commented section that checks for local environment and returns early to skip SMS sending.
I see! You want to enable the commented local bypass code. Looking at lines 29-33, there's a commented section that checks for local environment and returns early to skip SMS sending.

Let me uncomment that section and check the web.config for the setting:

I can see the web.config doesn't have the `isLocalorLive` setting. Let me add it and uncomment the local bypass code in SendOtpSms.cs:



Perfect! I've enabled the local SMS bypass for testing:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added `isLocalorLive` setting** to `web.config`:
   ```xml
   <add key="isLocalorLive" value="Local"/>
   ```

2. **Uncommented the bypass code** in [SendOtpSms.cs](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Parth/Desktop/2025/CERS-baseone/CERSWebApi/Models/SendOtpSms.cs:0:0-0:0):
   ```csharp
   isLocalorLive = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["isLocalorLive"];
   if (isLocalorLive.Contains("Local"))
   {
       return "SMS bypassed for local development";
   }
   ```

## How it works:
- When running locally, the SMS sending will be bypassed
- The method returns `"SMS bypassed for local development"` instead of calling the government SMS gateway
- The OTP is still generated and stored in the database normally
- You can now test the complete OTP flow without needing actual SMS delivery

## For Production:
To enable real SMS sending, simply change the web.config setting to:
```xml
<add key="isLocalorLive" value="Live"/>
```

Now you can test the OTP request and verification flow locally without SMS gateway connectivity issues!


? I notice there's no CheckOtp debug output in your logs, which means the OTP verification request isn't being made or isn't reaching the server. ? how did you know issue is in this based on no CheckOtp output 



## The server-side CheckOtp controller is returning "OTP Does not Match" (status code 300), but we never see the server-side debug logs I added to 
CheckOtpController.cs
.

This means the server-side debug output isn't visible in your client logs. We need to check the server-side Visual Studio debug console or server logs.

# You're right! The OTPID 1234 appears to be hardcoded. Let me search for where this static value is coming from:


I found the issue! There's likely a static OTPID override similar to how the OTP is hardcoded. Let me add a static OTPID for testing:

#  The recent records (15:42, 15:35) have empty otpmessage and smsresponse columns, while older records have populated values.


flow is:

"Bb41PVKSOg0yEIW/WQpL3w==" (Base64 string)
Convert.FromBase64String() → converts to byte array
Decrypt()
 → AES decryption on byte array
Encoding.UTF8.GetString() → converts decrypted bytes back to string



# The "date of filling expense is over" error suggests there's a date validation check that might be comparing against server time or a hardcoded deadline. Let me examine the key files to understand where this validation occurs.
 
# Based on my analysis of the CERSWebApi code, I can see that the "date of filling expense is over" error is coming from the SQL Server stored procedure sec.Mobile_saveData. The date validation logic is implemented in the database, not in the application code.

Here's what I found and the solution:


# Found it! The date validation is happening in the client-side code in 
DashboardPage.xaml.cs
. The error message comes from a localized string key "expensedateover".


Perfect! I found the issue. The date validation is happening in the client-side code in
